This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom v6: Unexpected route behavior due to overlapping path patterns.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where routes with similar paths lead to incorrect rendering or routing errors. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code, illustrating best practices to resolve path conflicts and ensure accurate route matching. This example highlights the importance of carefully designing route paths to avoid ambiguity and unexpected behavior.
